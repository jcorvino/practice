# practice
Practice problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview" 6th Edition (Problems 1.1-1.5 from 4th Edition).
Currently working on chapter 1.

Note: Many of the questions were originally intended for Java.
As a result, some questions ask to implement methods that are built-in or simpler in Python.
I attempted to solve the questions following the original intent of
the authors.

Git Hooks: There is a pre-commit hook to auto-update requirements.txt.
